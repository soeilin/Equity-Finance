# Equity Finance & Real Assets Modelling  
A focused collection of practical financial analysis work across Listed REITs, Real Assets, and Equity Research.  
The portfolio demonstrates the core analytical toolkit used in real-asset underwriting and listed-equity research, with emphasis on cashflow drivers, valuation logic, and scenario-based thinking.

This folder consolidates four modules that reflect how analysts assess earnings quality, variance drivers, liquidity profile, and valuation outcomes for REITs and capital-intensive platforms.

Sector focus:
• Listed REITs  
• Real Assets (Retail, Office, Mixed-use)  
• Infrastructure-like cashflow profiles  
• Equity Research workflows (forecast → valuation → presentation)

All models are intentionally **lightweight and intuitive**, designed to reflect industry logic without overstating sophistication.

## Module Overview

### 1. Earnings Forecast Pack  
A 3-scenario (Base / Bull / Bear) earnings forecast integrating  
• Lease → NOI  
• NOI → NPI → FFO → AFFO  
• 4-way sensitivity matrix (rent, occupancy, discount rate, capex)  
The pack illustrates how revenue/expense drivers roll up into dividend capacity and valuation impact.

### 2. Variance Reconciliation (Budget vs Actual)  
A diagnostic framework for explaining quarterly (QTD) and full-year earnings variances:  
• Rent bridge  
• Recoveries / OpEx  
• Interest expense movements  
• Timing effects & one-offs  
Designed for equity updates, internal management decks, and surveillance monitoring.

### 3. Liquidity & Capital Planning Pack  
A 13-week liquidity view tied to:  
• Cash inflows/outflows  
• Maturity wall  
• Facility headroom  
• Covenant cushion (lite version)  
Reflects how REITs manage short-term liquidity and medium-term refinancing risk.

### 4. Equity Valuation Pack  
A simplified valuation suite, including  
• DCF (levered/unlevered)  
• Cap-rate based NAV / implied yield sensitivity  
• Comparative multiples for NZX/ASX REIT peers  
Focuses on linking operational earnings to equity valuation outcomes.
