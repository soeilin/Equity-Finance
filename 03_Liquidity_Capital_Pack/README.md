# Liquidity & Capital Planning Pack  
A lightweight toolkit illustrating how REITs manage short-term liquidity, funding visibility, and refinancing timelines.  
The model intentionally focuses on intuitive mechanics rather than advanced treasury or derivatives modelling.

## Scope  
• 13-week cashflow visibility (operating cash inflows/outflows)  
• Facility headroom tracking (drawn vs undrawn limits)  
• Simple maturity wall mapping (6–36 months)  
• High-level covenant buffer illustration (interest cover / gearing – simplified)

## Purpose  
To demonstrate the logic used in monitoring liquidity sufficiency, identifying upcoming refinancing windows, and assessing how operational outcomes affect available headroom.

## Key Outputs  
• Weekly liquidity bridge  
• Facility utilisation snapshot  
• Maturity wall chart  
• Covenant headroom (simplified ratio view)  

## Tech Stack  
• Excel: linked schedules, driver-based cashflow, charts  
• Python (optional): simple rate-shock illustration using synthetic data  
  (kept intentionally lightweight — not a derivatives model)

## Notes  
All data is synthetic and the pack is designed to show analytical intuition, not treasury-level modelling.
